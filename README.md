# BugFlow
## React project that helps reporting error workflows

## About
BugFlow is a React web app that allows coders creating a visual workflow  
of bugs they need to share with someone else, e.g. to request help.  

## How does it work
The app is waiting for copy/pasted image or screenshot,  
allows adding text commentary, everythongs in steps. It's up to the user  
how many steps they make. After the bug flow is finished, added screenshots  
and text captions are processed to export as an image and automatically  
copied back to the clipboard as one big workflow, ready to share.

## Resources
- ReactJS and Tailwind, npm
