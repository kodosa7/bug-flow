# BugFlow
## React project that helps reporting error workflows

## About
BugFlow is a React web app that allows coders creating a visual workflow  
of bugs they need to share with someone else, e.g. to request help.  

## How does it work
The app is waiting for copy/pasted image or screenshot,  
allows adding text commentary, everything in steps. It's up to the user  
how many steps they make. When the user decides their bug flow has finished,  
added screenshots and text captions are processed foe export as an image automatically  
copied to the clipboard as one big workflow, being ready to share.

## Resources
- ReactJS and Tailwind, npm
